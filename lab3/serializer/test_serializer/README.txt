Auto serializer/deserializer unit test.

[1]: 	Run tb_serializer testbench simulation in WEBPACK ISE to generate data/serial_vector.txt
		out of data/in_parallel_vector.txt
[2]: 	Run tb_deserializer testbench simulation in WEBPACK ISE to generate data/out_parallel_vector.txt
		out of data/serial_vector.txt
[3]: 	Execute "bash run_test.sh"
[4]: 	If no diff output is present test was executed without errors

run_test.sh:
This script compiles serializer.cpp. Then it outputs serialized data generated by tb_serializer
and serializer.cpp line under line and diffs it. Then it outputs parallel test vector, and vector generated by
tb_deserializer and diffs it.

serializer.cpp:
Program C/C++ version of serializer which reads specified file and outputs its data in ascii '0'/'1'
serialized fashion with '1' added as start bit and '0' added as stop bit. Additional zeros might be present
in between input bytes.

For example:

ala.txt (no newline at the end of file):
ala

serialize.exe out.txt ala.txt
out.txt (no newline at the end of file):
0001100001100001001101100001100001100

Which can be parsed as:
000		- additional zeros
1 10000110 0	- 'a' ascii decimal 97  == 64 + 32 + 1
00		- additional zeros
1 00110110 0	- 'l' ascii decimal 108 == 64 + 32 + 8 + 4
00		- additional zeros
1 10000110 0	- 'a' ascii decimal 108 == 64 + 32 + 1
